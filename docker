what I have learned about docker

Why Docker
Docker is lightwieght, so resource consumption is low, fast. Ä°t ensures mobility of apps between machines. docker succeeds this by packaging both app and bins/libs in a container

#pull ubuntu container from hub.docker.com
docker pull ubuntu

#run container
docker run -d --name myfirst ubuntu

#list running containers
docker container ls OR docker ps

#stop a container
docker stop myfirst

#delete a container
docker rm myfirst
